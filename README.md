# Master-Thesis-VLAD-uncertainty
R-code files that were used for my thesis.
Not all of the code is mine. The code that is not mine is clearly marked in the R-files that use code that were provided to me by my supervisor. 
The code that was provided to me by my supervisor was only used to set up the model and not to get the actual results with the exception being the R-code for bayes_fit_HBB.R. 
Not all the code in the files was used in the thesis.
For the code files that analyse the HBB dataset, I have chosen 
to show the code, but the dataset is not available to the public; therefore, the files that use this dataset cannot run.
You are free to download and run the R files that use simulated datasets to test them for yourself.
