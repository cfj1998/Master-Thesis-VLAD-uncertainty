# Master-Thesis-VLAD-uncertainty
R-code files that were used in my thesis.
Not all the code in the files was used in the thesis.
For the code files that analyse the HBB dataset, I have chosen 
to show the code still, but the dataset is not available to the public, therefore, the files that use this dataset cannot run
You are free to download and run the R-files that use a simulated dataset to test them for yourself.
